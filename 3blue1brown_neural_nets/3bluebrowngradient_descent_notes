3Blue1Brown Gradient Descent
--------------

Cost function -> How far off from reality the network was
	-> Take the square difference of (what was expected - what you got)
	-> Goal of the network is to minimize this function (which means we got the least error possible)
		-> Analogous to finding the minimum of a function (calculus problem)
